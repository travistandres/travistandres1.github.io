        Mount Pinatubo is located on the Island of Luzon. This volcano is a stratovolcano formed by subducting plates.
        <br><br>
        On June 12, 1991, Philippine's Independence Day, Mount Pinatubo erupted, but this wasn't the only eruption it had. Three days later, more highly gas charged magma reached the surface and the volcano erupted with and ash cloud of 22 miles high. As lahar and pyroclastic flow charges it's path around the mountain, it filled deep valleys with volcanic deposits as much as 660 feet thick. This eruption was said to be the second-largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century.

       The Chocolate Hills is located in Bohol, Philippines, it is a group of concentrated hills with distinct shape. Although the hills are not that tall, it is a breathtaking view. When it is the end of dry season, the grass on the hills turns brown from green hence the name "Chocolate Hills."
       <br><br>
       Many people still doesn't know how the Chocolate Hills were exactly formed. According to an urban legend from the locals is that a young giant, Arogo, who fell in love with a mortal woman. When the woman died, as mortals must, the giant wept, and his great teardropsp formed the Chocolate Hills.
      <br><br>
      However, Geologists theorized that they are weathered formations of a marine limestone lying on top of an impenetrable clay base.

      The Hundred Island National Park is located in the province of Pangasinan. There are 123 Islands that are scattered along the Lingayen Gulf. They are belived to be around 2 million years old.
      <br><br>
      The islands are ancient corals that extend inland, in an area previously comprising the seabed of an ancient sea. Because of the lowering sea levels, they are exposed to the surface. The mushroom shaped like islands are caused by waves eroding the rocks. The Hundred Islands was officially declared a National Park on January 8,1940.
